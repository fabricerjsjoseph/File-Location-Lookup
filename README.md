# File-Location-Lookup

## Description

I created this web application (hosted locally) because I found Windows Explorer’s search function to be too slow and often returning incomplete results. The search function built into this web application app is lightning fast and produces more relevant results.

## Process Overview

Here is an overview of the steps taken:

1.	The “FM00” script generates an inventory of all files stored within a list of folders and export the data to a csv file (FM02). The search function is so fast because it performs searches on the inventory generated by this script instead of having to scan the directories every time a query is made. The inventory is updated automatically on a monthly basis and can also be updated whenever required.

2.	The “FM01” script builds the web application and the search function. What makes the search function powerful is its ability to use multiple keywords to perform a query, as well as restrict the search to selected folders only.
